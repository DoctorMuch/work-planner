# work-planner
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events each hour of the day.

* The user will open the planner and see the current day displayed at the top of the page.
* When scrolling, time blocks for standard business hours are shown.

* Time blocks are color-coded to indicate past, present, or future.
* Clicking on a time block allows for an event entry.

* Clicking save button saves to local storage, so saved events persist.
